# Pride Dining (Hofstra University)
Fully working build. Open `index.html` to see all restaurants immediately.
- On-campus Google Maps directions
- Open now (green) sorted to top, closed (red) to bottom
- Hofstra-themed dark UI
- Prefilled `data/locations.json` so it works offline
- You can still add the GitHub Action from the previous build if you want daily scraping
